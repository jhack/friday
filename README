This is a shell script that makes a Mac recite the lyrics to 'Friday' by Rebecca Black every Friday @ 7 A.M.

friday.lol.plist is set to run the friday.sh file every Friday @ 7 A.M. This can be edited, just run 'launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents' command after every edit.

TODO
Make an installer package to simplify installation process.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
Copy friday.sh to /sbin, copy friday.lol.plist to /Library/LaunchAgents, then reload LaunchAgents.

Open a new Terminal window and type the following (drag and drop friday.sh & friday.lol.plist to the Terminal window) -

sudo cp friday.sh /sbin/friday.sh
sudo cp friday.lol.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/friday.lol.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents
sudo chmod +x /sbin/friday.sh
